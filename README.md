### How to play (controls)

Use **LeftArrow** to go left  
Use **RightArrow** to go right  
Use **Up** and **Down** keys to stop  
Use **Space** to shoot enemies  

The logic of the game is simple. You are this spaceship on the bottom and bad invaders are comming to get you.  
You need to shoot and kill them before them get to you. You have *score points* and *ramaining bullets* on the top left.  
If you get shot, it's game over.
